However, if a financial instrument includes both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and the entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the loan commitment component from those on the financial asset component, the expected credit losses on the loan commitment should be recognised together with the loss allowance for the financial asset.

To enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amounts arising from expected credit losses, by class of financial instrument, has the following been disclosed:\r\n&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;the amount that best represents its maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (eg netting agreements that do not qualify for offset in accordance with IAS 32).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;a narrative description of collateral held as security and other credit enhancements, including:\r\n        &lt;ol type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;a description of the nature and quality of the collateral held;&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;an explanation of any significant changes in the quality of that collateral or credit enhancements as a result of deterioration or changes in the collateral policies of the entity during the reporting period;
