    <h2>CHAPTER 1: POLICY STATEMENT</h2>
    <h4>General Quality Policy Statement</h4>
    <p>The CPA practitioner\'s objective is to consistently uphold and enhance the quality of its services. This includes the development, implementation, and continual refinement of a robust system of quality management (SOQM) that at the minimum, meets the requirements outlined in the Philippine Standard on Quality Management (PSQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagement and PSQM 2, Engagement Quality Reviews.</p>

Thus, it actively fosters an environment where every team member is empowered to contribute to their continual enhancement.</p>
    <p>Every team member within the firm bears a shared responsibility for upholding quality and is accountable for complying with all established policies and procedures. Any revisions to the SOQM manual or the CPA practitioner\'s policies and procedures will be communicated to all members during regular team meetings.</p>
    <p>Documents pertaining to the SOQM shall be retained for a minimum of 5 years, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and professional standards.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER 2: RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS </h2>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner applies a risk-based approach in designing, implementing and operating the components of the SOQM in an interconnected and coordinated manner such that the CPA Practitioner proactively manages the quality of engagements it performs.</p>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner designs and implements a risk assessment process to establish quality objectives, identify and assess quality risks and design and implement responses to address the quality risks.</p>
    
    <h4>Quality objectives</h4>
    <p>Quality objectives are the desired outcomes in relation to the components of the SOQM to be achieved by the CPA Practitioner.</p>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner has established the quality objectives specified in paragraphs 28-33 of PSQM</p>
    <p>The firm has not identified any additional quality objectives considered necessary to achieve the objectives of the system of quality management. The quality objectives the CPA Practitioner has established are kept under regular review to ensure they reflect any relevant changes.</p>
    <h4>Quality Risks</h4>
    <p>A quality risk is a risk that has a reasonable possibility of:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>) Occurring; and</li>
        <li>) Individually, or in combination with other risks, adversely affecting the achievement of one or more quality objectives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner identifies and assesses quality risks to provide a basis for the design and implementation of responses. In doing so, the CPA Practitioner:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Obtains an understanding of the conditions, events, circumstances, actions or inactions that may adversely affect the achievement of the quality objectives, including:
            <ul>
                <li>With respect to the nature and circumstances of the firm, those relating to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The complexity and operating characteristics of the firm;</li>
                        <li>The strategic and operational decisions and actions, business processes and business model of the firm;</li>
                        <li>The characteristics and management style of leadership:</li>
                        <li>The resources of the firm, including the resources provided by service providers; and Law, regulation, auditing and assurance standards and the environment in which the firm operates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>With respect to the nature and circumstances of the engagements performed by the CPA Practitioner, those relating to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The types of engagements performed by the CPA Practitioner and the reports to be issued; and</li>
                        <li>The types of entities for which such engagements are undertaken.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>) Taking into account how, and the degree to which, these conditions, events, circumstances, actions or inactions may adversely affect the achievement of the quality objectives.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Responses</h4>
    <p>Responses (in relation to a system of quality management) are policies or procedures that are designed and implemented by the firm to address one or more quality risk(s):</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>) Policies are statements of what should, or should not, be done to address a quality risk(s). Such statements may be documented, explicitly stated in communications or implied through actions and decisions.</li>
        <li>) Procedures are actions to implement policies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner designs and implements responses to address identified and assessed quality risks in a manner that is based on, and responsive to, the reasons for the assessments given to those quality risks. The firm\'s responses include the responses specified in paragraph 34 of ISQM 1.</p>
    <h4>Iterative approach</h4>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner\'s SOQM operates in a continual and non-linear manner and is responsive to changes in the nature and circumstances of the firm and its engagements.</p>
    <p>The results of monitoring and remediation activities, results of external inspections and other relevant information (e.g., complaints and allegations) may identify information that indicates additional quality objectives, or additional or modified quality risks or responses, are needed due to changes in the nature and circumstances of the firm or its engagements. If such information is identified, the CPA Practitioner considers the information and when appropriate:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>) Establishes additional quality objectives or modifies additional quality objectives already established by the CPA Practitioner:</li>
        <li>) Identifies and assesses additional quality risks, modifies the quality risks or reassesses the quality risks; or</li>
        <li>) Designs and implements additional responses or modifies the existing responses.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Risk Assessment Matrix</h4>
    <p>The CPA Practitioner\'s risk assessment matrix is in Appendix A.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER 9: MONITORING AND REMEDIATION PROCESS</h2>
    <h4>Monitoring</h4>
    <p>MRP-01 In determining the nature, timing and extent of monitoring activities relating to the SOQM, the CPA Practitioner takes into account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The reasons for the assessments given to the quality risks;</li>
        <li>The design of the responses;</li>
        <li>The design of the firm\â€™s risk assessment process and monitoring and remediation process;</li>
        <li>Changes in the system of quality management;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Individuals performing monitoring activities are required to have the competence and capabilities, including sufficient time, to perform those monitoring activities effectively.</p>
    <p>All engagements are reviewed by the engagement partner before the report is issued to the client. This engagement review includes reviewing whether the firm\'s system of quality management has been adhered to. When issues are identified or errors are uncovered during engagement reviews, the system is reviewed and practical changes that should reduce the risk of future similar errors are made. When identified as a requirement, relevant training programs will be arranged to address issues uncovered during monitoring procedures.</p>
    <p>MRP-02 Monitoring activities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A culture assessment, focusing on the CPA Practitioner\'s commitment to quality in IC-Form-</li>
        <li>[Quarterly/ Semi-Annual/ Annually/ Other Period], the individual assigned operational responsibility for the SOQM, the [audit quality leader/other personnel/external service provider], conducts an informal assessment of the firm. This is discussed with appropriate team members at team meetings, and appropriate follow-up actions are implemented.</li>
        <li>Inspection of completed engagements - a review of a completed engagement file for each partner will be conducted [at least once every three years/ other cyclical basis]. Engagement team members or the engagement quality reviewer of an engagement are prohibited from performing any inspection of that engagement. The Engagement Review Form is in MRP-Form-01.</li>
        <li>The CPA Practitioner is also subject to review and oversight by [insert name of professional accountancy organization).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Remediation</h4>
    <p>MRP-03 The [audit quality leader/other personnel/external service provider] evaluates the findings from the monitoring activities to determine whether deficiencies exist. The severity and pervasiveness of identified deficiencies are evaluated by investigating the root causes) of the identified deficiencies, and evaluating the effect of the identified deficiencies, individually and in aggregate, on the SOQM.</p>
    <p>Remedial actions to address identified deficiencies that are responsive to the results of the root cause analysis are designed and implemented. Remedial actions should identify ownership, timeframes and should articulate what effectiveness looks like and how this will be evaluated. If there are significant changes needed as a result of findings, action plans may be needed to ensure these are implemented effectively.</p>
    <p>A Findings Register is in MRP-Form-02 while the Deficiency Evaluation Worksheet is in MRP-Form-03.</p>
    <p>MRP-04 The [audit quality leader/other personnel/external service provider] evaluates whether the remedial actions are appropriately designed to address the identified deficiencies and their related root cause(s) and determine that they have been implemented. The [audit quality leader/other personnel/external service provider] also evaluates whether the remedial actions implemented to address previously identified deficiencies have been effective. If the evaluation indicates that the remedial actions were not appropriately designed and implemented or were not effective, the [audit quality leader/other personnel/external service provider] takes appropriate action to determine that the remedial actions are appropriately modified such that they will be effective.</p>
    <p>When findings indicate that there is an engagement for which procedures required were omitted during the performance of that engagement, the CPA Practitioner takes appropriate action to comply with applicable auditing and assurance, and professional and ethical standards and relevant legal and regulatory requirements. When the report is considered to be inappropriate, the CPA Practitioner considers the implications and takes appropriate action, including considering whether to obtain legal advice.</p>

    <p>EQR.01 An engagement quality review (EQR) must be undertaken for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audits of financial reports of listed entities;</li>
        <li>Audits or other engagements for which an engagement quality review is required by law or regulation;</li>
        <li>Audits or other engagements for which the firm determines that an engagement quality review is an appropriate response to address one or more quality risk(s).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>EQR.02 For all other assurance engagements, the CPA Practitioner will consider the following criteria when determining whether an EQR should be performed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Level of engagement audit risk - if the level of audit risk is considered to be high then it is more likely that an EQR is required.</li>
        <li>Seniority of staff conducting the engagement - the need for an EQR might reduce with the higher levels of audit team experience/proficiency.</li>
        <li>Any EQR conducted on this engagement in prior years - if an EQR has been conducted in recent years the need for a current year review may be reduced in some cases, depending upon the reason for an EQR in prior years.</li>
        <li>Findings/recommendations of any previous EQR - if the EQR revealed few issues, the need for a current year EQR may be reduced.</li>
        <li>The EQR may recommend the frequency of subsequent EQRs but the results of internal monitoring should also be considered (e.g., risk areas or for specific partners).]</li>
